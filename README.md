##  Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study**, where I analyzed Fitbit fitness tracker data to help **Bellabeat**, a women-focused health tech company, identify user behavior patterns and create data-driven marketing strategies.

As a Business Analyst with 2–3 years of experience, I conducted this project to **upskill**, strengthen my analytical toolkit, and demonstrate my ability to perform **end-to-end data analysis using R and Tableau**.

##  Business Task  
Use Fitbit device usage data to understand:

- Daily activity levels  
- Sleep habits  
- Calorie burn patterns  
- Weekly trends  

…and provide **actionable recommendations** for Bellabeat’s product and marketing strategy.

- Removed duplicates & missing values  
- Created new variables for analysis  
- Exported a clean dataset for reporting

##  Insights  

### **1. Users are moderately active**

### **2. Sleep habits are generally healthy**  
Average sleep duration is 7.4 hours.

### **3. Strong link between steps and calories**
